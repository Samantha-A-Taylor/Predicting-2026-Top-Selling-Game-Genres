| **Plot / Visualization**                                             | **Placement / Section**   | **Focus / Caption**                                                                                                          | **Notes / Tips**                                                                                                 |

| **Heatmap of Game Genre Frequency (Exploded)**                       | EDA                       | Shows intensity of top-selling genres across 5-year periods. Highlights dominant, emerging, or declining genres.             | Annotate counts. Use a clear sequential colormap (e.g., `BuGn`). Exploded genres show multi-genre contributions. |
| **Stacked Bar Chart by 5-Year Intervals**                            | EDA                       | Displays proportional composition of genres. Makes it easy to see which genres dominate each era.                            | Use consistent colors per genre. Good for cross-period comparisons.                                              |
| **Grouped Barplot by 5-Year Periods**                                | EDA                       | Shows detailed counts of genres within each period. Highlights trends and shifts not obvious in stacked bars.                | Exploded data ensures multi-genre games are fully represented.                                                   |
| **Linear Recency-Weighted Probability Bar Chart (2026)**             | Recency-Weighted Forecast | Prioritizes recent trends while still considering historical data. Top genres are easy to identify.                          | Include exact probability values on top of bars for clarity.                                                     |
| **Exponential Recency-Weighted Probability Bar Chart (2026)**        | Recency-Weighted Forecast | Emphasizes current trends more strongly. Shows which genres are currently gaining momentum.                                  | Adjust τ (e.g., 3–5) and note effect in caption.                                                                 |
| **Recency Weight Curve (Exponential Decay)**                         | Recency-Weighted Forecast | Visualizes how recent years influence predictions more than older years. Confirms model emphasis on current trends.          | Optional: annotate key years with weight values.                                                                 |
| **Weighted Probability Grouped Bar Chart (Top 10 Model Comparison)** | Model Comparison          | Compares linear vs exponential weighted predictions side by side. Highlights consistent top contenders and divergent genres. | Add optional fit/trend line across both models for visual guide.                                                 |
| **Time Series of Genre Proportions (Observed Data Only)**            | Time Series Trends        | Irregular time series shows actual emergence, dominance, and disappearance of genres across years.                           | Avoid interpolating missing years to preserve real data gaps.                                                    |
| **Summary Table: Top 10 Predicted Genres (Linear vs Exponential)**   | Key Insights              | Quick reference for analysts to see predicted probabilities and differences between weighting methods.                       | Include % probability and rank side by side for clarity.                                                         |
